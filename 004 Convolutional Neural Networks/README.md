## Models

Model files are large (>100 mb). Github wouldn't let me upload them. So here is where to download them from and which folder they go in.
File | Location 
---|---
[ResNet50.h5](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keras/resnet50) | week2/ResNets
[yolo.h5](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmoharir8396/yolo-h5-file) | week3/Car detection for Autonomous Driving/model_data
[imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teksab/imagenetvggverydeep19mat) | week4/Neural Style Transfer/pretrained-model

The location is where the file should go. Clicking the links in the above table will download the files
